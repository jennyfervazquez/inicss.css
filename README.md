# inicss.css
So I was tired of write the same CSS for each page (like size of columns and flex and the styles by deafault) and I decided to do this sort of "css" that you can use.

This code will provide:
- Sizes of columns using %.
- Sizes of columns for different devices.
- Variables for code colors so you don't have to navigate to the bottom of the css to change them.
- Flex classes so that you can add it to the html and not having to edit the css each time you create a div or writting css only for a "flex" prop.
- Some other things that I will put here if I need them (or you).

Feel free to submit some of your needs to me and I will see what I can do with my little knowledge.

LIST OF TO DO'S:

- Variables.
- Columns size:
  - 100%
  - 80%
  - 75%
  - 50%
  - 33.33%
  - 25%
  - 20%
 - Flex class.
  - Vertical
  - Horizontal
  - Box sizing
